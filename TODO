MUST FOR 1.0
tests!
layout strings (at least a good default)
use yargs for entire repl?
 - autocomplete - use new node repl as guide, we can show rest of parameters for function calls?
 - suggestions?
 - history
enable/disable individual breakpoints
components:
    layout components? - tabs/draggable splitters?
    watchers?
vim plugin
better error handling in sagas

NICE TO HAVE
tooltip widget - React portal?
add wrap options
 - word
 - newline
colors for eval command - buffer drawChars with ansi escapes
dturbo - run dev version of turbo
    - another npm package
    - dturbo link
        - points a config file at cwd (the turbo dev folder)
    - dturbo -- the rest
use node-pty to implement a tmux replacement for windows users
show prompt for picking session when more than one is running

SOON:
// split set-breakpoint into set-breakpoint-request and set-breakpoint
// use getPossibleBreakpointLocations to select best location
// and then submit with set-breakpoint
// in set-breakpoint, set raw from actualLocation
